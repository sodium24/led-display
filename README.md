# led-display Python Application Framework

This repo is a free WIP Python software framework designed for a 64x64 LED matrix display. It is built on top of the `rgbmatrix` library and is a simple way to get apps running on your display. Some of the features include:

- Extensible with your new applications
- Simple graphics and text display, abstracted through the use of controls
- Switch apps via a wireless joystick game controller, a web interface, or a TCP socket server/client interface
- App customizations via JSON
- Some built-in apps include:
   - Image/logo/clock display
   - Slideshow for picture display
   - Snake game you can play with a joystick


## Pairing a wireless joystick

See [Pairing a wireless joystick](pairing_wireless_joystick.md) for detailed instructions on how to pair your joystick to the display.
